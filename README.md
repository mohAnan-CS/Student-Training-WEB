# Student Training Company
The Student Training Company project is a website designed to connect companies with trainees, facilitating easy communication and the exchange of special training offers. The platform aims to provide a seamless experience for both companies and trainees, ensuring efficient and effective training opportunities.

The website utilizes a combination of HTML, CSS, PHP, and PhpMyAdmin technologies to create a dynamic and interactive platform. HTML is used for structuring the content and layout of the web pages, CSS for styling and visual enhancements, and PHP for server-side processing and database interactions. PhpMyAdmin is employed as the database management system to store and retrieve relevant information.

By utilizing this technology stack, the Student Training Company project aims to streamline the process of connecting companies with potential trainees, ultimately enhancing opportunities for professional growth and development.
